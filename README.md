# Capstone-Project-PB-
In this project, we analyzed a medical insurance dataset using Python to better understand its details and find key insights. First, we cleaned up the data by removing any duplicates and filling in missing information, which helps make our findings more reliable. We changed categories like 'smoker', 'region', and 'sex' into number form using a method called one-hot encoding, which makes it easier to work with in our analysis. We also grouped people into different BMI categories to help us see patterns more clearly.

After cleaning the data, we standardized the 'age' and 'bmi' values to make sure they're on the same scale, which is important for comparing them accurately and using them in future models. We made a lot of charts to look at the data: histograms to see how 'age' and 'bmi' are spread out, and boxplots to compare how much different people pay for insurance based on whether they smoke or where they live. We also created a correlation matrix, but left out categories that couldn't be turned into numbers, to see how different factors are related. This thorough analysis not only helped us understand what affects medical insurance costs but also set the stage for more advanced studies, like building models to predict costs.
